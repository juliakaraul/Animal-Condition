# Animal Condition
A Dataset on classification of Animal Conditions was taken from: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gracehephzibahm/animal-disease/data"

The dataset contains a wide range of animal species, ranging from birds to mammals, this dataset enables the development of predictive models to determine whether an animal's condition is dangerous or not based on five distinct symptoms.

The process of manual data collection introduces potential sources of error, including spelling mistakes and variations in symptom representation.

The "Animal Condition" project is an effort to clean the data and explore it closer by performing EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis).
The "ML Animal Condition" notebook is aimed to look dipper into the data and predict if the animal condition is dangerous based on the symptoms with the use of SVC + KNN.
