# Animal Condition
A Dataset on classification of Animal Conditions was taken from: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gracehephzibahm/animal-disease/data"

The dataset contains a wide range of animal species, ranging from birds to mammals, this dataset enables the development of predictive models to determine whether an animal's condition is dangerous or not based on five distinct symptoms.

The process of manual data collection introduces potential sources of error, including spelling mistakes and variations in symptom representation.

This project is an effort to clean the data and explore it closer.
